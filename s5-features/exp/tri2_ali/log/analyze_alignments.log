The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 19.5% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 85.5% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 5.9% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 1.1 hours of data, or 0.9 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 4.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (14,20.6,54)
